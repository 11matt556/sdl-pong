Project due date: 5/2/2017

Project description: Create a complete game with a consistent theme/story and a conclusion.

The easiest part of this project: Making this readme.

Problems that I had in completing this project:

Collisions were troublesome to get working and although they mostly work, if the ball hits the top of paddle it does not bounce as expected. I wanted to implement more proper collisions so that the bounce would be based on how the ball hit the paddle, but didn't have time.
